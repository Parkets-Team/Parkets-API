# Project Overview
Selected Theme: Tourism, Cultural, and Hospitality

Title of the Project: ParKets (Parking Tickets)

Problem Statement: Parking area management in shopping centres or public places that are crowded centres is often less effective and efficient. When there is a surge of visitors, there will usually be a long queue when entering/exiting the parking area plus motorists also need to go around looking for available parking slots, of course this can also be difficult for visitors.
